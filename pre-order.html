                     The EcoBoost model features the newest generation of the four-cylinder 2.3-liter turbocharged EcoBoost, making over 310 horsepower, and it is Ford's most powerful EcoBoost. The turbocharged EcoBoost allows for it to make great power
                     with just simple bolt-ons. But it only comes with the 10-speed automatic transmission. This is a good efficient car making great power and an EPA-estimated over 21 mpg city and 32 mpg highway.

                     The GT model features the newest generation of the Coyote 5.0-liter V-8, which makes 480 horsepower, but it is also Ford's most powerful GT. The engine features dual air intakes feeding to dual throttle bodies, making it breathe in
                     more air than ever, and making more power. This also allows for it to make good power with just simple bolt-ons. It also has an option to be paired with a six-speed manual (Getrag transmission) or 10-speed automatic transmission.

                     The all-new Dark Horse trim features many performance parts from the GT500 and the Mach 1, making the Dark Horse the most track-capable Mustang that doesn't have a Shelby badge. Not only does it feature the newest generation of the
                     Coyote 5.0-liter V-8, which makes 500 horsepower, but it is also Ford's most powerful Mustang. The engine features dual air intakes feeding to dual throttle bodies, but in the Dark Horse, it is enhanced even more than the GT version.
                     It also has an option to be paired with a standard Tremec six-speed manual or the famous 10-speed automatic.
